FOR COMPILATION:

1. Setting up environment for compilation:
	
	export TNT_DEFAULT_INC=makefile_devrelease_nag.inc
	module load openmpi/1.8.4__intel-2015
	export DIR_NAG=/system/software/linux-x86_64/lib/nag/fortran/fll6i26dcl

	The latter is for issue with nag license
	
	
2. Compilation: type

	make
	
	to compile the files of interest
	
	
FOR RUNNING	

1. Modify the files dmft_arcusb1.sh and load_arcusb1.sh as required.

2. To run in front, for test, type the running instruction at the end of the file dmft_arcusb1.sh.

../bin/main_EQ-DMFT_TNT -d /data/phys-tnt-library/jmendozaarenas/EQ_DMFT_TNT/output/ -o ../initfiles/init_eqdmft1.mat

3. To run in background:
